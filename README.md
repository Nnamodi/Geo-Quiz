# Geo-Quiz
This is a simple quiz app that tests your knowledge on environmental facts.
It has a cheat button that can save you from loosing some points on questions that may pizzle you.
Of course your points are counted and displayed as a toast at the answer of the last question.
And since cheating is deterred, there's a limited number of cheat and when exceeded, disables the cheat button automatically.
Not forgetting the answer buttons that are also disabled but when question is answered.
